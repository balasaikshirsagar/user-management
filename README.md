This project is a web-based user management system designed to handle multiple user roles with varying levels of access. It allows for seamless login and registration, user profile management, and role-based redirection. The system includes functionalities for administrators (superadmin and admin) to manage users, approve pending accounts, and monitor user activities. Regular users (user) can manage their profiles, view dashboards, and request approval if their accounts are pending. The application leverages a secure PHP backend integrated with MySQL for data storage and retrieval, and utilizes AJAX for efficient communication between the frontend and backend.  Key Features: Role-Based Access Control: Differentiates users based on roles (superadmin, admin, user) and redirects them to appropriate dashboards. User Approval: superadmin and admin can approve new user accounts, making them active and accessible. User Profile Management: Users can update their profile details, including name, email, and password. Dynamic Dashboards: Different dashboards for superadmin, admin, and user, each tailored to their specific needs and permissions. Security: Secure login using hashed passwords and session management to protect user data. Responsive Design: Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive design, ensuring compatibility across devices. Technologies Used: Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript (AJAX) Backend: PHP, MySQL Authentication: Password hashing, session management APIs: AJAX for data exchange between frontend and backend
